[Train cnn models to perform multi-class disease detection](https://github.com/tortoiseJess/xray-image-cnn/blob/master/densenetTraining_ok.py)

## Explores Dataset:
[nih_all_images_dataExplore.ipynb](https://github.com/tortoiseJess/xray-image-cnn/blob/master/nih_all_images_dataExplore.ipynb)

## Analyse Results:
1. Average AUC, PRC comparision of different CNN models 
2. Finding out which disease is more easily detected in the results, as a way to investigate the feature detection in relation to type of model.<br>
